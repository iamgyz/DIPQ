User can query dynamic IP by using server-side Restful-API.  \r\n\r\n## Purpose  \r\nFor the hosts which are using dynamic IP and their home-gateway do not support ddns.\r\n\r\n## Feature  \r\nIn client host, just run the application and enter your id, say 'qoo'. \r\nAnd the you can visit `http://<your-server-IP>:5566/qoo` to query your dynamic IP ANYWHERE!  \r\n\r\n\r\n# Client-side\r\n\r\n## Python version  \r\n\r\n### Install  \r\n1. `pip install paho-mqtt`  \r\n2. `git clone https://github.com/iamgyz/DIPQ.git`  \r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n1. `cd client-side/python`  \r\n2. `python3 client.py`  \r\n\r\n## NodeJS version  \r\n\r\n### Install  \r\n1. `git clone https://github.com/iamgyz/DIPQ.git`  \r\n2. `cd client-side/nodejs`  \r\n3. `npm install`  \r\n\r\n### Usage  \r\n1. `npm start`  \r\n\r\n# Server-side  \r\n\r\n### Install  \r\n1. `git clone https://github.com/iamgyz/DIPQ.git`  \r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n1. `cd server-side`  \r\n2. `python3 server.py`  \r\nCheck http://<server IP>:5566 to check if the server is running well or not.  \r\n\r\n# Live DEMO  \r\nI've run a server application on my host http://gyzlab.com:5566  \r\nSo you can just clone client-side code and run it, and then you can query your real-time dynamic IP via http://gyzlab.com:5566/your-id\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
